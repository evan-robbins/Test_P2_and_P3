Dummy Object
A dummy object is required to execute the test, but not really needed for anything useful.

Stub
A stub takes care of the indirect inputs of a class by providing some values to the SUT.
A stub needs to be instructed about what values to return when its methods are invoked.

Spy
Test spies take care of indirect outputs and verifies the actions of the SUT.

Mock
Mocks are very similar to test spies but differ in syntax and flow of the code within test the methods.
